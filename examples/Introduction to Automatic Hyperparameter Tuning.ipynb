    "Also, notice how there are border effects to the left and right of the charts when we use `Quantized(...)` as a distribution wrapper to round the numbers. Those weird border effect wouldn't appear if you'd limit the distribution to half numbers instead of plain number. Let's say you have a `Quantized(Uniform(-10, 10))`: then the samples from approximately -9.5 to -8.5 are rounded to the bin of the number -9, but the values from -10 to -9.5 are rounder to the bin -10 and a half is missing, so the -10 bin sees its values sampled half as often as -9. That explains the border effect, and you could fix it easily by taking the uniform range from -10.49999 to 10.49999."

Let's look at a concrete example below. "
